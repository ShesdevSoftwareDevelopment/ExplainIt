* **What is this repo or project?** 

I started to develop this site in 2015 to allow Youtube influencers to sell their content through a simple to use VOD platform. I had no previous coding experience, so I started from CodeAcademy and worked my way from there, with StackOverFlow. I wrote raw code, with no framework, and finished years later with a working product, tens of thousands lines of code but no real advantage when it came to the competition.  

* **How does it work?**

The code is pretty messy, and was not written with an Object Oriented approach, since I didn't know of it at the time. Different libraries with various names were used. The file flow starts with index.php.

* **Who will use this repo or project?**

Whoever is intersted in offering a simple, very cheap way of uploading a paid-for course to the web. Has no real CMS, so most of the things need to be hard coded.

* **What is the goal of this project?**  

The initial idea was to make high quality explanations available to the world. We didn't get to that point.

## Instructions for how to develop, use, and test the code.

The files need to be downloaded from git, and the code sequence starts from index.php.
